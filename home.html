                                <p class="titles">Viben (VN) is a social platform in development that is being built as an alternative to other platforms e.g Discord & Guilded. The main benefits of using Viben compared to other platforms is that Viben aims to be completely secure and privacy focused, provide an enhanced and fair experience to our users and aims to be completely open-sourced & transparent.</p>
                                <p class="titles">This project was started between me and a very good friend of mine. We were highly unstatified with some of Discord's practices with user safety and privacy, so we began planning and building our own platform that offers the privacy and safety that we believe every user should rightfully have.</p>
                                <p class="titles">In the future we hope Viben can become the place that many users use to communicate and share interests amongst each other without worrying about their personal data being used or sold.</p>

                                <p class="titles">
                                    This originally started as a joke that I originally had no intentions at the time of making this into a fully fledged bot, but to my surprise they were impressed and actually wanted it to be in their server. So I jumped at the opportunity and it became one of my greatest projects I have made. 
                                    I have spent months ensuring everything was up to standard and working properly so they can receive a product that will work right out of the box. 
                                    I went through many struggles dealing with hundreds of lines of code, including a database, which I took as a major learning experience and a way to improve how I write code.

                                    Currently, the bot only has a few features such as: Auto Moderation, Custom Shop, and Custom Currency.

                                <p class="titles">I am actively working on the bot to ensure it is properly optimized and all features are working as it should.</p>

                                    I believe it is a skill that can grant me better job opportunities and be used for possible future projects.

I have always worked with computers and helped others with their computer problems when I was younger, so working with them has been a big norm for me. 
                                    I enjoy learning about systems, software, hardware, and security and would love to learn more in depth on how they operate.</p>
