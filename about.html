                                    I go by the alias of Sinmysize (you can also refer to me as Sin). I am a intermediate developer with a huge passion for programming, Internet of Things (IoT), and technology. 
                                    Ever since I was first introduced to technology, I have always wanted to learn more of how our devices operate and made. Throughout my life I slowly learned about the inner workings
                                    of how computers are created and how they utilize each compontent to run the apps and tools we use daily. The biggest gateway to my learning of technology was through gaming. 
                                    Gaming was the biggest factor of beginning my journey in programming and creativity.
                                </p>
                                <p class="titles">
                                    One of my earliest attempts of programming was game development. As a child I played a game known as Roblox. One of the software it included when installed was Roblox Studio. 
                                    In my attempt I went through what most programmers call "Tutorial Hell". I spent many hours watching tutorials that never taught me the basic fundamentals of programming in general, so I shortly gave up and pushed it aside. 
                                    But in my stubbornness I tried again, but this time I did not try to make a game.

                                <p class="titles">
                                    Later on I began to try web development. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and made a very poorly made website - but nonetheless it was a website. 
                                    This later introduced me to Javascript, which after many trials and errors - and the help of a very good friend of mine (Thanks Sol) - I learned my first language. 
                                    From that point on I began working with NodeJS to create many small projects and branched to other programming languages. This later started my interest in IoT with the use of an Arduino.

                                <p class="titles">One of my most obvious interests are computers. I love seeing computers that are decades old or brand new and seeing their internal components. Often times in stores with computers I find myself browsing and looking at the specs of them. Even random pieces of tech interest me a ton.</p>
                                <p class="titles">Outside of technology, I do enjoy smaller hobbies like photography and music. I typically use these as a method to get away from sitting infront of a screen for several hours per day. I am actively learning how to play the guitar - specifically an electric guitar - so I could do music production as a hobby as well.</p>

                                <p class="titles">Programming has been my greatest skill ever since I first learned my first language. I have made many small projects in the form of Discord bots using <a href="https://discord.js.org/" target="_blank">discord.js</a>. Some of the few languages I have either primarily used or tried out are C, C++, C#, Javascript/Typescript, Rust, and Lua.</p>

                                    Although not known by most, I actually take a small interest in photography/cinematography. I began taking pictures of landscapes and sunsets/sunrises and loved the first few pictures I took. This also translated into games - specifically Minecraft.

                                    With the use of shaders and some client sided modifications, I managed to take cinematic photos of structures and landscapes in Minecraft. Using what I learned from previous photos I taken, I took very stunning photos of amazing structures of the world including some player made structures in a public server. A few members of the server took notice of my skill and wanted to use a few of them in their Instagram. I really enjoy taking pictures of the many builds that such creative people have spent countless hours building and displaying it for others to view. Some of my work can be seen on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/play.violetsmc/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page.
